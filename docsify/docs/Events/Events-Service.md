## Understanding the Events API

The Events API is an independent service within the homerealm family management system, built using .NET. Its main purpose is to help families manage specific, common calendar events—such as birthdays, holidays, appointments, and school activities—by providing a dedicated place to create, track, and organize these important dates.

## Purpose

The Events API is designed to make it easy for families to keep track of recurring and special events that matter most, especially those generated from non-digital sources—like a doctor’s office, school, or individual family members. It manages extra details and monitoring for each event, such as reminders or attendance, and ensures that all relevant information is up to date. When an event is created or updated, the Events API pushes the information to the Calendar API for display on the family’s shared calendar.
